# wrichard-finalproject

The aim of this project is to expand on my previous work with FIDE's chess ratings dataset. I would like to create an interactive world map that allows a user to explore ratings data for different countries. Part of the data processing will require me to decide whether the Federations:Countries mapping is 1:1. The federation titles already match some common three-letter ISO country codes, so it might just be an issue of making a translation dictionary from `Fed` to some new variable `Country`, but I am not certain of this. Of note is the issue of players with no country flag, or federations linked to contested land. It might be a good approach to text mine the names and information of federations straight from FIDE, since their data only mentions a code and has no backup table with a reference for what the three-letter federation code maps to.
